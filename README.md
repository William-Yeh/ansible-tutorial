## Preparation

Before experiment with the lab material, complete the following environment setup:

1. Install VM software:

   - Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), an excellent programmable VM environment.
   - Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), or purchase more powerful VM software such as [VMware Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/tw/products/workstation/), [VMware Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/tw/products/fusion), and [Parallels Desktop](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/).

   Or, read the article "[Playing VMs with Vagrant](http://www.codedata.com.tw/social-coding/vagrant-tutorial-2-playing-vm-with-vagrant/)" (in Traditional Chinese) for more information.


2. Install Ansible client:

   ... using Homebrew mechanism (on Mac):

     ```bash
     brew install ansible
     ```

   or, using Pip (on Linux or Mac) since Ansible was written in Python:

     ```bash
     pip install ansible
     ```

3. Done!
